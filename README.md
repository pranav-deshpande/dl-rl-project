# Deep Reinforcement Learning to Play Side Scrolling Video Games
Deep Reinforcement Learning Project

Game playing is an important & interesting task in the field of AI and Deep Learning. One way to train AI agents to play video games is use reinforcement learning; in which an agent learns to make actions in an environment with the appropriate reward as feedback from the environment. Here, we create a custom agent to play the classic 1995 side scrolling game, captain play, then use Deep Q-Learning to train an AI agent to play the same.

## Steps

1. Obtain [Captain Claw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claw_(video_game)).
2. Download [Anaconda/Miniconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)
3. Open the conda terminal and run: conda create -n rlenv python=3.10
4. conda activate rlenv
5. Finally, clone this repository and open the notebook 'deep-reinforcement-learning-project'.
6. Download and install [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract)
7. Locate the path for the claw and tessarct executables in the notebook and input them.
8. Uncomment the first cell and run it to (pip) install all the required libraries.
9. Follow through the notebook to train the agent(s) to play Claw.
